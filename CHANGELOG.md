# Changelog of the AskAnna Backup Helper

## 1.1.0

The backup of files was always using gzip, which could make it slow to make a backup. In this update, we made it
configurable if you want to apply compression to the file backup archive.

We also improved the code quality and added GitPod config.

## 1.0.0

The first version of the AskAnna Backup Helper with support to backup and restore files and PostgreSQL databases. And
to upload and download backup files from Google Cloud Storage Buckets.
